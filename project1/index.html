                <h2>Missile man Of India</h2>
                <p><b>Subhash Chandra Bose</b>, known as Netaji, was a pivotal figure in India's struggle for independence, renowned for his unwavering dedication and charismatic leadership. Born in 1897, Bose's profound commitment to nationalism led him to establish the Indian National Army (INA) in 1942, advocating for India's liberation from British rule. His famous slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" epitomized his fervor and determination, inspiring millions to join the fight for independence. Despite facing adversity, Bose remained resolute, seeking support from various quarters, including Germany and Japan during World War II. Tragically, his life was cut short in a mysterious plane crash in 1945, but his legacy of courage and patriotism continues to inspire generations in India and beyond.</p>
